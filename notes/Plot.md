Plot notes
==========

CAUTION: Here be spoilers. And unsettled stuff.

Opening cutscene
----------------

The first seven minutes of the movie (with Joy narrating) is a big opening and
scene-setting. Joy's infodumps come from the DM. The players are discussing
things, talking about their powers perhaps. Lines from other emotions can be
dropped in during this time.

DM: "This isn't a typical meet-in-a-tavern scene. You're meeting inside Riley's
mind. Riley is an eleven-year-old girl and you're seeing the world through her
eyes - literally."

First real session
------------------

The removal van and departure from home is your first encounter. Rather than
combat, this story revolves around incidents in Riley's life, and giving Riley
an internally-consistent response to each incident.

(Which means that the dinner scene (with The Foot) is a failed encounter for
the PCs.)

Will need to figure out how to logically define success.

Encounters:
* Car travel
* First sighting of the house
* Scrunched paper hockey? Or that might be part of the preceding encounter.
* Pizza
* Conversation with Mum
  - Sadness passes the DM a note saying she's frobbing the memory
  - This is the beginning of the discovery of what her power is.
  - Sadness then uses her power a bit more and shows that it is consistent
* Convo with Joy and Sadness. What are the other three doing?
  - Maybe they're just tossing in OOC comments, saying nothing IC?
* "Crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems."
  - DM snickers and awards Sadness some bonus XP
* Maybe XP gets awarded for everyone who can be convinced to exhibit the
  emotion that you epitomize? So if Joy can make Sadness happy, Joy gets XP?
* The dream is just the DM's closer, attempting to summarize the session, but
  Joy decides to interact with it. One quick line and that's it.

Second session
--------------

Starting at 0:20:00 in the movie, this day is First Day At School.

* Fear mentions being called on by the teacher. Cue the DM.
  - Skip most of the actual details. "Riley talks about stuff from MN."
* Sadness frobs the memory while nobody is watching
* When the Core Memory arrives, Sadness knows that she's scored big, but also
  that messing with it will cause big problems.
* Joy: "I shove the core memory into the recall tube."
* Sadness and Joy roll inits and some opposed checks
* Fear, Disgust, Anger? Maybe just talking OOC again?
* Collat damage turns off the other cores and one gets sucked into Recall.
* Joy does a STR check to try to grab and hold the core memories
* Sadness: "Hang on, lemme do an assist." Successfully rolls the assist.
* F/D/A: "You got this, Joy!"
* Joy rolls her STR check, adding in the +2 from Sadness... and fails the DC
  by 5. DM rolls d% and says that she - and Sadness due to the assistance -
  get caught up by Recall.
* "Well, thanks guys. On the plus side, since you've now neatly split the
  party, I don't have to throw out my carefully-prepared plot that requires
  that you be in HQ."

Encounter: Dinner with Mum and Dad
* DM: "Okay, so while Joy and Sadness explore long-term, you three have the
  console."
  Fear: "Fine. The encounter XP is way more than any of the personal awards,
  so - pact? We try to win this as a team, not for ourselves?"
  Disgust, Anger: "Sure."
  DM: "Can you say that IC?"
  Fear (IC): "Until she gets back, we just do what Joy would do!"
* Disgust: "I have the best Bluff check of all of us. I'll Bluff being Joy."
  *roll* "3."
  Anger: "Can I say that curse word now?"
* Fear takes his Bluff check. A better roll but a worse modifier. DM won't
  say what the DC is, but they haven't exactly rolled well enough to know.
* Anger rolls Bluff. Not a bad roll but still failure.
* Anger throws the encounter and goes for personal XP.
* DM awards pitiful encounter XP, plus a little bit of personal for Anger.
* "New plan, guys. We gotta get Joy and Sadness back up here."
* DM: "I guess that's it for this week. Next week, looks like we're starting
  with a split party. That's always fun."
