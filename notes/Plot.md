Plot notes
==========

CAUTION: Here be spoilers. And unsettled stuff.

Opening cutscene
----------------

The first seven minutes of the movie (with Joy narrating) is a big opening and
scene-setting. Joy's infodumps come from the DM. The players are discussing
things, talking about their powers perhaps. Lines from other emotions can be
dropped in during this time.

DM: "This isn't a typical meet-in-a-tavern scene. You're meeting inside Riley's
mind. Riley is an eleven-year-old girl and you're seeing the world through her
eyes - literally."

First real session
------------------

The removal van and departure from home is your first encounter. Rather than
combat, this story revolves around incidents in Riley's life, and giving Riley
an internally-consistent response to each incident.

(Which means that the dinner scene (with The Foot) is a failed encounter for
the PCs.)

Will need to figure out how to logically define success.

Encounters:
* Car travel
* First sighting of the house
* Scrunched paper hockey? Or that might be part of the preceding encounter.
* Pizza
* Conversation with Mum
  - Sadness receives a note from the DM suggesting that she frob the memory
  - This is the beginning of the discovery of what her power is.
  - Sadness then tries out her new power and finds that it is consistent
* Convo with Joy and Sadness. What are the other three doing?
* "Crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems."
  - DM snickers and awards Sadness some bonus XP
* Maybe XP gets awarded for everyone who can be convinced to exhibit the
  emotion that you epitomize? So if Joy can make Sadness happy, Joy gets XP?
* The dream is just the DM's closer, attempting to summarize the session, but
  Joy decides to interact with it. One quick line and that's it.
