# Panel definitions
# Lines that start with a hash are comments
# Blank lines are ignored

# A panel has a width and height.
# Eventually all panels will be given a visual frame at that exact size.

	# Inside one panel, we have a series of pieces.
	# A piece can be cropped from an existing frame:
	2839[450,0,880,480,200,...](50, 50)
	# Or from a text string:
	"Joy"(150, 0)
	# Either way, it is positioned at a particular (x, y) on the target.
	# Expressions may be flowed onto additional physical lines if indented.
	# TODO: Gravity? It might be easier to position text by centering it.

	# When cropping, you can also scale to (x,y) or to (x,...) or (...,y)
	# where the latter forms will maintain aspect ratio.

# For speech bubbles, maybe they can be done by having the origin be the tip
# of the stalk, and then you give a direction and length to link that to the
# text? Also, it may be worth having ALL text start out origin at the center
# of the text box, and to allow any object to be chained to any other with a
# speechy stalk, which will change its origin to be the new tip. So then, if
# you put another piece of text after it, you'll overlay that, and then that
# one's stalk would come out from there, etc. Maybe (ab)use subtraction? And
# this would mean all objects would need a retained origin.

# Would be nice to have a "conversation mode", where two (or more) chains of
# text boxes are automeasured by each other. Or maybe a single chain of text
# boxes has two (or more) independent stalk links.

# A text box chain may need to be connected to a character at either the top
# or the bottom (start or end of the chain). The order of text boxes in this
# file should correspond to the intended reading order, but if they fill the
# space ABOVE the character, the LAST one will join to him/her; contrariwise
# if the text boxes are BELOW the character, the FIRST one will join both to
# the character and to the next text box. Speech is hard. Words are hard.
