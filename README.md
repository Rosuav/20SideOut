20-Side Out
===========

This is (or will be (or might be, if ever I finish the project)) a screencap
webcomic based on "Inside Out". The panels will be clipped from the movie using
FFMPEG and a Python script, with the goal being that the entire process can be
driven by text files.

Notes in this file will be spoiler-free. If you read the internal notes in
[their own file](NOTES.md), you may expose yourself to spoilers both for the
original movie and for the webcomic. Also, stuff may change (in the webcomic,
not the movie) prior to release.

The Setting
-----------

Everything that happens during the movie is the result of a gaming session. The
five emotions (Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger) are player characters;
everyone else (including Riley herself) is an NPC. The Dungeon Master is not
afraid to lean on the fourth wall, and the players (like most gamers) are apt
to break it at times.

The game system used here is some variant of a classic D20 system, though the
details are not given.

Credits
-------

Disney created "Inside Out" itself, thus making all this possible.

The Comic Irregulars inspired this project via ["Darths & Droids"](http://darthsanddroids.net)
which you should definitely check out. It's way better than this will ever be.
